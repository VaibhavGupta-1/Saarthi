## üéØ The Problem

This project is a solution for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) problem statement aimed at tackling the decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges in Jammu & Kashmir.

> At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness; most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions.

Saarthi aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly, mobile-first platform for personalized guidance.
